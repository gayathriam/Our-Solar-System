★ Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
<br>
★ Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.
<br>
★ One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun in 687 Earth days.
<br>
★ Mars is a rocky planet. Its solid surface has been altered by volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.
<br>
★ Mars has two moons named Phobos and Deimos.
<br>
★ Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.
