★ Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.
<br>
★ While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface
<br>
★ Earth orbits our Sun, a star. Earth is the third planet from the Sun at a distance of about 93 million miles
<br>
★ Our atmosphere protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface.
<br>
★ Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other ingredients,the perfect balance to breathe and live.
