★ Saturn is the sixth planet from our Sun and orbits at a distance of about 886 million miles from the Sun.
<br>
★ Saturn is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface like Earth’s. But it might have a solid core somewhere in there.
<br>
★ Saturn takes about 10.7 hours to rotate on its axis once a Saturn “day” and it takes 29 Earth years to orbit the sun.
<br>
★ Saturn has 53 known moons with an additional 29 moons awaiting confirmation of their discovery—that is a total of 82 moons.
<br>
★ Saturn has the most spectacular ring system, with seven rings and several gaps and divisions between them.
