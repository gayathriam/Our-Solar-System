★ Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
<br>
★ Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.
<br>
★ Jupiter orbits about 484 million miles or 5.2 Astronomical Units from our Sun
<br>
★ Jupiter is a gas giant and so lacks an Earth-like surface. If it has a solid inner core at all, it’s likely only about the size of Earth.
<br>
★ Jupiter has more than 75 moons.
