★ Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.
<br>
★ It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.
<br>
★ The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes.
<br>
★ Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar system.
<br>
★ The Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite to what we experience on Earth.
<br>
★ Venus rotates very slowly on its axis – one day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
